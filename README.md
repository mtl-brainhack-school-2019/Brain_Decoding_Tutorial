# Brain Decoding Tutorial

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/kongnorman_BrainDecoding/master)

This repository is my project for the Montreal 2019 BrainHack school. It contains four documents that will help you get started with a basic brain decoding workflow. My project is an attempt to contribute to the lack of beginner-friendly resources in the fields of computer and neuroscience. See the
final_report.md for more info. 

You can also check out a short introductory [video](https://youtu.be/8NXdLCt9ltw) to get you started!
