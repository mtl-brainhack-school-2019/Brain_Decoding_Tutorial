# Predicting from Brain Data

This is an introductory brain decoding tutorial. 

### Goal

My goal is to create an accessible, extensive but easy to understand fMRI brain decoding tutorial for those who are new to the subject.

### Materials

Separate Jupyter Notebooks will be used for each step of the process. Libraries to be used are indicated in the requirements.txt file. 

### Main Steps

1. Learn what the heck fMRI imaging is and how fMRI data is stored.
2. Learn how fMRI data is analyzed.
3. Find a high quality, preprocessed dataset.
4. Compare several models to form our predictions.
5. Review results (see what worked, see what didn't, etc.)
